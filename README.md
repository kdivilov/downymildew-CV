# Computer vision system for downy mildew and leaf trichomes
The computer vision scripts in this repository have been used to quantify downy mildew sporulation and leaf trichome percent area in grapevine leaf discs. An [upcoming paper](http://FirstLookPhytopathology) explains how the scripts were used to analyze real data from grapevines. In addition to the scripts, a guide is provided to acquaint a beginner with how to operate the scripts and the technical details of the scripts. Two sets of leaf disc images are also included for testing purposes: one of the *Vitis rupestris* B38 x 'Horizon' grapevine F<sub>1</sub> family, which has no leaf trichomes, and one of the 'Horizon' x *Vitis cinerea* B9 grapevine F<sub>1</sub> family, which does have leaf trichomes. The test images are of leaf discs at 7 days post-inoculation from two separate experiments performed, one on each family.

If you have any questions about the scripts, feel free to open an issue on the repository.
